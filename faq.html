				<hr>
				
				<div class="question">
					<p class="lead">COVID-19 Update</p>
					<p>With COVID-19 unexpectedly hitting 2020, we decided to adjust our wedding plans and have our wedding in Baltimore. A Harbor wedding was not our original plan at all, but it was important for us to be married on our 5 year anniversary, so we're making it work!</p>
					<p class="mb-0">We're taking several precautions since we're having our wedding during a pandemic. Our ceremony and reception will be entirely outdoors, we'll have a max of 25 people in our space, and we're kindly asking that our guests wear masks while they're not eating or drinking. If someone were to get sick from attending our wedding, we'd have a hard time forgiving ourselves, so it's better to play it safe.</p>
				</div>
				
				<hr>
				
				<div class="question">
					<p class="lead">Face Masks</p>
					<p class="mb-0">Out of respect to all of our guests and the restaurant staff, we're kindly asking that everyone wear face masks throughout the entire night, unless they're eating or drinking. We'll be providing both masks and hand sanitizer for all of our guests, so you can feel comfortable and sanitize at any point during the night.</p>
				</div>
				
				<hr>
				
				<div class="question">
					<p class="lead">We're keeping it intimate.</p>
					<p>Family is super important to both of us, and we have a whole lot of it. For our wedding, we've decided to keep things small with immediate family and close friends only.</p>
					<p class="mb-0">That being said, we would love to include and celebrate with the rest of our family in other ways after our wedding weekend when the pandemic is over.</p>
				</div>
				<hr><hr>
<!--
				<div class="question">
					<p class="lead">You should fly into El Paso.</p>
					<p class="mb-0">The fastest way to get to White Sands, New Mexico is by flying into El Paso International Airport and driving North. White Sands and Cloudcroft are 1–2 hours from El Paso, and 3–4 hours from Albuquerque.</p>
				</div>
				<hr>
				<div class="question">
					<p class="lead">You'll want to plan on renting an SUV.</p>
					<p class="mb-0">The drive to The Domes includes about 10 miles of unpaved, winding mountain road through Lincoln National Forest. The drive will likely be intimidating the first time up, but you shouldn't run into any issues with an SUV.</p>
				</div>
				<hr>
				<div class="question">
					<p class="lead">The wifi sucks pretty much everywhere.</p>
					<p class="mb-0">Plan ahead for an amazing, mostly-unplugged weekend.</p>

					<p class="lead">Where is the wedding?</p>
					<p class="mb-0">The wedding ceremony will take place at a restaurant in Fells Point called Ampersea, at 1417 Thames Street, Baltimore, Maryland. After the ceremony, Ampersea will reconfigure the space for the reception.</p>

				</div>

				<div class="question">
					<p class="lead">Where should I park?</p>
					<p class="mb-0">Although there is a parking lot located right next to the restaurant, it is only available for monthly parkers during the week until after 5:00 PM. You can park at the <a href="https://www.pmi-parking.com/r/parking/view.aspx?record_id=83" target="_blank">1530 Thames Street garage</a> and Ampersea is less than a 5 minute walk from there.</p>
				</div>

				<img src="img/garage.png" class="img-fluid">
				<hr>
				<div class="question">
					<p class="lead">Is there a dress code?</p>
					<p>The dress code for our wedding is 'casual dress' attire. Ladies should take the wind into consideration if picking out a dress for the ceremony. Gentlemen can wear a suit and tie or khakis and a blazer.</p>
					<p class="mb-0">We'd like everyone to look fairly unified and ask that you stick to our earthy color palette of <mark style="background-color: #102F3D; color: #fff;">navy</mark>, <mark style="background-color: #577480; color: #fff;">blue</mark>, <mark style="background-color: #486248; color: #fff;">green</mark>, and/or neutral colors (<mark style="background-color: #E2D3C1;">tan/brown</mark>, <mark style="background-color: #444444; color: #fff;">black/gray</mark>, <mark style="background-color: #f0ebe6;">white</mark>).</p>

				<div class="question">
					<p class="lead">What will the weather be like in October?</p>

				<div class="question" data-aos="fade-up">
					<p class="lead">Where will the reception take place?</p>
					<p>The reception will take place at The Domes Nature Retreat at <strong>1201 West Side Road, Cloudcroft, NM 88317</strong> (about an hour drive from White Sands National Park).</p>
					<p class="mb-0">The drive to West Side Road is only about 20 minutes from the dunes, but it takes about 30-40 minutes to drive to The Domes from the start of road. </p>

<!--
				<hr>
				<div class="question" data-aos="fade-up">
					<p class="lead">Why October 23, 2020?</p>
					<p>On October 23, 2015, we went on our first date, after casually talking on Tinder earlier that year. Exactly 3 years later, Griffin proposed. October 23 is the only day we’ll ever have to remember when it comes to our relationship.</p>
					<p class="mb-0">2020 is the first year our anniversary didn’t fall on a week day (kind of, it’s still a Friday). It also happens to be Griffin’s rotation year in pharmacy school, so he can easily take off during our wedding month.</p>
				</div>

<!--
				<hr>
				<div class="question">
					<p class="lead">Why a destination wedding?</p>
					<p>We love traveling together almost as much as we love each other. Summer 2016, we drove up to Ithaca, NY and Niagra Falls, which was our first big trip together. The following year, we traveled to Iceland and drove around the entire country. Since then, we’ve traveled to Colorado, Virginia, NYC, Oregon, Washington, Vancouver, and New Mexico. At our age, traveling is expensive, but we make it work.</p>
					<p class="mb-0">We’ve known for a while we wanted to get married outdoors with a gorgeous, natural backdrop. Why pay for an expensive venue when we can go somewhere beautiful to exchange our vows for a fraction of the cost?</p>
				</div>
				<hr>
				<div class="question">
					<p class="lead">Why White Sands?</p>
					<p>Shortly before our engagement in 2018, we took a trip to Colorado and visited our first National Park together – Great Sand Dunes. It was there we fell in love with the gorgeous juxtaposition of mountains and sand. We’ve all (probably) seen beach sand, but that doesn’t even begin to compare.</p>
					<p class="mb-0">We spent a lot of time looking for locations and we kept coming back to White Sands National Park. It’s stunning, it’s conveniently located, it’s pet friendly, and it’s south enough to still have nice weather in October.</p>
